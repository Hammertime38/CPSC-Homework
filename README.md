CPSC Webmaster Coding Challenge
===============================

This is a simple coding exercise to figure out how much (if any) of my current workload can be delegated to a shiny new Webmaster. Also, if you cheat and mess with tests or test runners, I'll use Git magic to immediately find all of the exact code changes you made...so that's sort of counterproductive.

The only file you'll need to mess with is src/skiClubber.js. If you open SpecRunner.html in a browser, you want everything to turn green, meaning super totally awesome fun times test passes. I'm looking to see how you solve problems and am very good at sniffing out plagiarised code quickly, so please just take the time to try to figure everything out yourself. Also, I don't think StackOverflow is going to tell you how to make a SkiClubber drink a BeerBong and purge the foam, so there's that.

Lastly, don't stress out. It's chill. This isn't Cisco, it's CPSC, so crack a beer and code with spunk.
